# Instructions for use:
Running the code will require MATLAB and Simulink

Download copies of the .m-files and .mat-files

Open the 'main.m' file, and specify values for the parameters as required. The user can select to load the simulated fault data used in the paper, or to run the Simulink model of the milling circuit with or without simulated faults.

Descriptions of the other .m-files are contained in the .m-files.
